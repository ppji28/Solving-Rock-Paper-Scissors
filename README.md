# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# CSS Styles (styles.css)
- Background Styling: The background color of the game is set to a soothing
- shade of blue (#f4f4f4) to create a pleasant visual experience.
- Container Design: The game container is styled with a white background (#fff), subtle border radius, and a light box shadow for a clean and modern look.
- Header: The header section features a dark background (#333) with white text, creating a visually appealing contrast. It uses padding to add space around the text.
- Choice Buttons: The game choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors) are presented as buttons. These buttons are designed to be user-friendly with padding, font size, and cursor pointer styling.
- Result Display: The result of each round is displayed with a distinct background color (#0ff) and an increased font size for emphasis.


# HTML (index.html)
- A container <div> to enclose the entire game.
- An <h1> element for the game's title.
- Buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors choices, each enclosed in a <div>.
- A result display section using a <p> element.


# JavaScript (script.js)
- Game Logic: The JavaScript file defines the game logic. It determines the winner of each round based on the player's choice and the computer's random choice.
- User Interaction: The player can make a choice by clicking one of the buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). The JavaScript code handles the user's choice and randomly generates the computer's choice.
- Display Result: The game displays the result of each round by updating the text content of the result display section. It informs the player whether they won, lost, or tied with the computer.
